/*
Write a program to swap every alternate element of a given array starting for element 0
For example, let's say we have a[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}, the result should be a[5] = {30, 20, 10, 40, 50}
one more example a[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60}, the result should be a[5] = {30, 20, 10, 60, 50, 40}

Topics to be covered
- Arrays
- Loops
- Basic Operators
