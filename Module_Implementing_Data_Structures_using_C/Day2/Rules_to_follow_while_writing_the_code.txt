Rules to follow while writing code
• Write code as a function that can be called from main
• Pass all the arguments/inputs needed for the function to work with
• Return the result from the function to main
• Avoid using printf and scanf inside the function but can be used in main
• Use meaningful names for variables and functions
• Consider error conditions and handle in the code accordingly.
