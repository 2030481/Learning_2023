# Activities to use the exisitng code and modify as per the given problem statement

## Rules to follow while writing code
* Write code as a function that can be called from main
* Pass all the arguments/inputs needed for the function to work with
* Return the result from the function to main
* Avoid using printf and scanf inside the function but can be used in main
* Use meaningful names for variables and functions
* Consider error conditions and handle in the code accordingly

### Array based Challenges
